# FAST TRACK: Complete in 1 Day!

## Reality Check: 3 Days is TIGHT

Converting 13 custom 3D models to IQM with proper animations could take **2+ weeks** for someone experienced.

## SMART SOLUTION: Use Existing Models + Customize

Instead of creating new models, we'll:
1. ✓ Copy existing Xonotic "Erebus" character model
2. ✓ Create 13 variants with different colors/skins
3. ✓ Add custom character names and descriptions
4. ✓ Create unique ability configs for each
5. ✓ Package as mod

**Time estimate:** 4-8 hours (DOABLE TODAY!)

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create 13 Character Variants (2 hours)

Each character gets:
- Copy of erebus.iqm model (same 3D model)
- Custom colored texture (edit .jpg file)
- Custom .txt file with character info
- Custom .skin file pointing to textures

**Color scheme for 13 characters:**
1. Bas - Red/Orange (leader)
2. Berkay - Brown/Tan (Turkish theme)
3. Gefferinho - Dark Red (rage)
4. Hadi - Gold/White (Dubai theme)
5. Luca - Ice Blue (winter arc)
6. Nitin - Orange/Fire (fire theme)
7. Yigit Baba - Red/Gold (Turkish)
8. Fufinho - Purple/Brown
9. Efe abi - Green/Brown
10. Jad - Red/Yellow (KFC colors)
11. Umut - Cyan/Tech colors
12. Keizer Bom Taha - Military Green
13. Goon Lord Tobese - Dark Blue

### Step 2: Character Info Files (1 hour)

Create .txt file for each with:
- Real name
- Ability name (from Rust game)
- Description
- Voice line

### Step 3: Ability Configs (2 hours)

Create config files that modify:
- Movement speed
- Damage multiplier
- Health/armor
- Starting weapons
- Special abilities (via mutators)

### Step 4: Package & Test (2 hours)

- Package as .pk3
- Test in Xonotic
- LAN multiplayer test
- Balance adjustments

## Alternative: Download Pre-made Characters

**Xonotic Forums:**
- https://forums.xonotic.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=12

**Search for:**
- Custom player models already in IQM format
- Download 13 different models
- Just rename and customize .txt files

**Time:** 3-4 hours

## Recommendation

Use the **color variant approach** for Day 1 to get a working prototype.

If time permits on Day 2-3, download better models from Xonotic forums to replace the colored variants.

This ensures you have a **PLAYABLE GAME** even if time runs out!
